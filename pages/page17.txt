- All right, bro! - the warrior pats you on the back until you almost fall over. - Let's see what he's worth! 
You get to the training ground, where several other recruits are waiting. The mercenary hands you sticks, divides you into pairs, and tells you to fight each other. The last time you fought was as an apprentice, but luckily your opponent is also inexperienced, so you manage to beat the crap out of him. While you help the unfortunate man up, a member of the Swords of the Sun approaches you. 
- Okay, you're good! - he declares, looking you in the face. 
And so begins the next stage of your life. You learn to fight in close formation and march to the beat of a drum. Sometimes you escort a caravan or protect a rich man, and sometimes you take part in great battles and sieges. Sometimes you starve in a besieged city, dreaming of catching a rat, and sometimes you feast on expensive wines in the cellar of the defeated ruler. You work your way up the career ladder, becoming first a decurion and then one of three centurions. 
Slowly, age begins to take its toll on you. All-day marching makes your bones break and your movements in battle become slower and slower. You begin to think about finding a quieter way to live. Soon, an opportunity presents itself. The company commander makes a deal with the rulers of a coalition of cities planning war against the Kazraites, and one of your comrades-in-arms tells you that the King of Bashar is planning to expand the palace guard. 
- He will certainly welcome an experienced warrior like you - your friend declares. 
No, I will not let the opportunity for revenge against the Kazraiths slip through my hands (page 30)! 
Palace life will be a nice change (page 7).
