You go into town. At the gate, the guards tell you to pull up your shirt to check for signs of illness. You walk through the streets. You pass a cart with the bodies of the dead pulled by a gravedigger. You reach the Temple of Wisdom and meet the scribe. The scribe does not want to leave the shrine, you must bribe him. After a moment of negotiation you agree on a sum. The scribe will settle for about three quarters of the silver you have. 
Together you go to the farm. The scribe sits down in a chair by Hradesz's bed, pulls out a scroll, a container of ink and a pen. In a weakening voice, your former master dictates his will. He declares that he has no relatives in this world, so he bequeaths his entire estate to his farmhand, you. Soon after he finishes dictating, Hradesz dies. 
- Are you the heir? - asks the scribe. - You are a lucky man. You're immune to disease, and now you've been given a farm. But there is nothing for me here. I'm going back to the temple, I'll put my will in the archives. 
You arrange for Hradesh to be buried. Within a week the plague dies out and the situation in Bashar calms down. You now own the farm. For the time being, you will have to work on it alone, so you will have to do a lot of hard work. But after a while you will find a helper... or maybe a wife? The future will tell. In any case, fate has given you a chance, don't waste it.
