- It's good to meet an honest man! - declares merchant. - I am Naser, he says, burdening You with part of his packages. You both are on Your way. During travel, Your companion mainly speaks, You understandably do not want to share stories from Your past. Fortunately, Nasser is talkative, so it's enough if You nod every now and then. Your companion never was a professional soldier, but he gought in few holy wars, when the Prophet called for levy in mass. He is a childless widower. He's going to start his own bussiness, for now he goes from town to town trading in trinkets, spices and so on. 
You arrive to the town. Here Naser sells horse and buy another one, healthier. He gives You few silver coins. 
- It's for Your help – he says. - Maybe... You want tcontinue our journey? I am riding to Letahak. I am afraid taht on way some robbers could attack me, in two it's always safer. 
You have nowhere to go, but you want to leave the Bashar area as soon as possible, therefore you agree to Naser's proposition. When traveling with a merchant, you will arouse less suspicion. 
So You go on. Naser is still talking. H e begins to complain about her compatriots and the Prophet. 
- I was fighting in the holy wars, bu not liking it – he says. - I see, one people invade another, they take a loot and slaves, it's normal thing. But exterminating all cities to the last baby, only beacuse some of citizens was doing „abominations”? Who cares if they read the stars or kept hookers by their temples. Anyway, even in times of peace it is hard to live among us, the Kazraits. Priest are still saying – this is prohibited, because abomination, that because it's in, something anohter is heresy, and if something isn't heresy, it is surely spiritual danger. I'm sick of it. It is reason, why I went into the world. 
- You arrive at the city of Letahak, where Naser sells his wares iand buys new one – and also a cart, where he will load these goods. Also, he offers You a prtnership. 
- Well, maybe not an partnership – he corrects. - Cooperation. Because I will be the more important one, investment is mine! But I need companion and helper. 
You agrees.  You have nowhere to go anyway. Szarleh is destroyed adn You can't come back to Baszar. Life of merchant's helper won't be bad. Youuwill see, what destiny brings.
