You've been jumping on Narfela all evening. You pay her compliments, grant her every wish, never leave her side. The giggling girl is delighted with your adoration. Soon you are lying next to each other, the woman feeding you grapes from a tray and periodically tapping your muscles. Watchful guards make sure neither of you goes too far. 
The birthday party ends and you return to your quarters. The next day, routine, exercises since morning. But the day after tomorrow, Aszakar comes to you. 
- I have news - he announces. - Narfeli is crazy about you. She wants to marry you. Her father refused her at first, she tried to slit her wrists. He says it's you or none. And you know what, Ogabad agreed. He must really love that girl crazy. He wants to buy you from me and set you free. And I will sell you. I don't want to make an enemy out of a mighty merchant, and the sum is really nice. But... - Ashakar suspends his voice for a moment. - I have a proposition for you. Don't give up fighting in the arena. Some of the gladiators are free men, seeking fame... And gold. I would share the profits with you. It would be a shame to waste what you've achieved. 
You must be crazy! I have the opportunity for a prosperous, peaceful life, and you want me to continue risking my life every day (page 71)? 
I'm not going to give up the arena. Wife and father-in-law will have to put up with it (page 48).
