You throw yourself at the merchant. He is so surprised that at first he does not defend himself at all. He falls under your weight. You choke him and smash his head against the ground. The Kazrait finally begins to resist, but you prove stronger. The trader struggles weaker and weaker until he finally dies. You wait a moment to make sure. Yes, he is dead. You killed him. 
The rage begins to leave you, it's time for reflection. You're an escaped slave, and now a murderer. You can't just stand over a dead body. Nor can you continue on your way to the town, or someone might recognize you. 
Taking your horse by the reins, you look over the merchant's goods. Some that are easy to carry, but valuable, such as boxes of spices you take with you. You bypass the nearest town and continue on the trail. On the way you have to leave your horse, the maimed animal is not able to go further. Soon you run out of supplies. You reach the next town, Letahak, in your last strength. At the local market you sell your goods for far less than they are worth. You do not know how to bargain. With a little silver in your pocket, you have to think about your future. You know a little about handwork, so you make your way around the local workshops, asking if anyone is looking for a helper. After a few tries you come across a carpenter who hires you. You help him and his wife with the housework and learn a bit of the trade. For a while you can't sleep at night - you are afraid that someone will recognize you as a runaway slave. But then you calm down and get used to your new life. It's been worse.
