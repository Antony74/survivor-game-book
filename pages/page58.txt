As you wish - Hradesz says, shrugging his shoulders. - I hope that you don't regret it later - he adds. 
You get a pie for the road from Renel and set out for Bashar's nearest neighbor, the city of Letahak. First you try to become an apprentice with some craftsman, but to no avail. But you finally manage to find a job. You will be helping to expand the estate of some rich merchant. At the beginning you do really simple things - carry bricks, hold a ladder - for a miserable pay, but when the foreman chases away one of the bricklayers for drunkenness, he gives you a chance to take his place. You work hard and make a good impression, so you become a permanent member of the bricklaying crew. You rent a corner to sleep in, have something to eat and something to put on your back. That's not so bad. Considering that your skeleton could now be lying among the ruins of Szarleh, you could even be called lucky.
