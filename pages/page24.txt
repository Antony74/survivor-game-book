You convince Aszakar to entrust you with training new gladiators. The man is somewhat skeptical of your teaching talents, but agrees. You deal with a new batch of freshly purchased slaves. They have heard of your fame and at the sight of you they tremble as if they have met Death himself. 
After a week, you have quite a few bruises and abrasions, one fracture and one corpse on your conscience, as well as a group of fairly trained gladiators. Your pupils score a decisive victory in their first skirmish. Aszakar appreciates your work and allows you to continue training them, as well as entrusting more slaves to your "caring". You can tell that you care about their welfare. After all, your training from hell increases their chances of survival. 
With time, Aszakar gives you more and more tasks. Not only do you train gladiators, but also search for new fry at the market and take care of food for your "charges". One day Aszakar starts to fall ill. He has a fever and coughs up blood. 
- I won't lie and say that you are my beloved friend - he states while lying on the bed. - But I have no family anyway, and I don't want my life's work to be destroyed and forgotten. I will bequeath my estate to you. 
You summon the town scribe, who writes a will. When Ashakar dies, you become the owner of the arena and gladiator school. You were once a slave who was dragged here by force. Now they do it to other people at your command. Do you feel remorse, or are you proud to have improved your lot? Decide for yourself.
