You spend the next days organizing the coup. Amongst your decurions you find a few who potentially might want take part in it â€“ a man, whom the king has recently ordered punished for a stumble during the parade with three days of arrest, or a soldier who has gotten himself into debt playing dice and is in desperate need of gold. Soon the Vizier informs you that the coup will happen tomorrow. 
Masked assassins attack when the monarch is eating grapes. Your handpicked guards surrounding the ruler do not intervene. One of the assassins stabs the king in the breast with a dagger. You allow killer to escape through a window, while royal servants start to scream. Your people, instead of calling a medic, run around and shout to increase the panic. 
On the same day the Grand Vizier declares himself the new king. You are the first to swear an oath of loyalty to him. One of the other two centurions follows your example. But High Commander and last centurion are reluctant to recognize the new ruler. 
"It is not right for anybody to take the throne in such a hurry," says commander, "and why you, Vizier? We need to consult on how to choose a new king. Consult the Oracle. Maybe we should organize a tournament, and it's winner be crowned?" 
The third centurion nods his head to show that he supports his commander. 
"You want to deepen the chaos after the death of our beloved master?" shouts the Vizier, "I am on to you, traitors! Assassins wouldn't slip between the guards if they had no supporters among the command! Arrest them!" 
Your men catch two officers. Soon they are executed and the new king is officially crowned. You, as promised, become the new guard commander. You've come a long way from a scared slave.
