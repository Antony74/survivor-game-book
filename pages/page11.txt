You spend the next days on organizing a coup. Between Your decurions You find a few, who potentially might want take part in it – man, who was whom the king had recently ordered to punish for a stumble during the parade with three days of arrest or a soldier, who has made himself debts playing dices and is in desperate need of gold. Soon vizier informs You that a coup will be carried out tomorrow. 
Masked assasins attacks when the monarch ie aeting grapes. On Your mark guards surrounding the ruler dont't intervene. One of assasins stab king with a dagger in the breast. You allow killer to escape by a window, while royal servants start to scream. Your people, instead calling a medic, run around and shout to increase panic. 
On the same day the grand vizier declares himself the new king. You are the first to swear an oath of loyalty to him. One of the other two centurions is following your example . But highest commander and last centurion are reluctant to recognize the new ruler. 
- It is not right for anybody to take the throne in such a hurry – says commander – And why you, vizier? We need to consult on how to choose a new king. Consult the oracle. Maybe we should organize tournament, and it's winner will be crowned? 
Third centurion nods his head to show that he supports his commander. 
- You want to deepen the chaos after the death of our beloved master? - shouts vizier. - I am on to you, traitors! Assasins wouldn't slip between the guards if they had no supporters among the command! Arrest them! 
Your men catch two officers. Soon they are executed and the new king is officially crowned. You, as promised, become the new guard commander. You've come a long way from a scared slave
