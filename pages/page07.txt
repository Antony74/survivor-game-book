You take the postion of royal guard centurion. It's a quieter job. You are in charge of organizing the drill exercises, setting up guards, running parades and punishing of offenses. Food is good, and bed in your room is comfortable. The king can sometimes be a bit capricious, but not cruel, and highest commander of the guard is reasonable man. But it doesn't mean that everyone is glad with their rule. 
One day you are invited to a metting with Great Vizier. When you go to his chamber, you meet the overseer of the royal stables and high treasurer too. 
"Greetings centurion", says the Vizier, pointing you to the seat next to him, "We gathered here to discuss an important matter. Our current king is lazy and reckless. We have to replace him with a better ruler", he declares, stroking his second chin. "It would be beneficial for you to participate in our plot. As foreigner and former slave you will never be promoted above the centurion, you will never become Supreme Commander... Unless a king favorable to you takes the throne. So? Are you with us? 
Of these dignitaries, only the equestrian has combat experience, but there are three of them, and each has knife in his belt. You can't simply refuse them, or they'll silence you forever. But you can pretend you agree to take part in their conspiracy. Unless you really want to participate. 
I sincerely agree with the Vizier (page 11). 
I pretend to join the plot, but as soon as I can, I will tell about it my commander (page 36).
