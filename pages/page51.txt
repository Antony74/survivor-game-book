You go home. For the next few weeks, you face hard work, with the entire farm on your mind. After a while, Hradesh's hand heals, and Chilosz is back to himself enough to help you. But Renel never gets over his son's death. He says nothing, sits for days and stares out the window. Because of the memory of old times, Hradess feeds her and keeps her in his house. 
After a few years Bashar is struck by a plague. It is not the worst plague in history, only some of the inhabitants get sick. However, in your household, the plague affects everyone but you. Renel and Chilosz die quickly, leaving you alone with Hradesz, whose skin is covered with red spots. Fortunately, you are immune. 
Your former master hovers on the bed and asks you to bring a scribe. - Perhaps he will be afraid to come - says Hradesz. - Pay him whatever he wants. The bag with the silver is hidden in the stove. I will not take that money to the other world either. 
You pull out a bag of money and walk into town. On the way you count the silver. A nice sum. It would be a shame to waste it all on a gift for the scribe. Part of the money is yours. After all, Hradesz has not yet paid you for the years you were a slave. Besides, he said himself, this money is no longer of any use to him. 
Half of the silver belongs to me. The scribe will have to make do with the rest (page 20). 
No, the will of the dying is sacred. I'll pay the scribe what he wants, take the rest back to Hradesz (page 41).
