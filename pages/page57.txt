Over the next few days, you train yourself to use your new power. Your magical gaze moves in ever-widening circles around the island. One day you spot a small merchant ship. You make the wind carry it away from your island. Surprised by this turn of events, the sailors begin to explore the new land. Soon they come across a temple. Several of them go inside. As they stand before you, you introduce yourself as the ruler of this island and command them to obey you. They mock you, at which point you make a knife wielded by one of the newcomers pop out of its scabbard and stab him in the throat. Several times. When the sailor dies, his companions gain respect and bow to you. 
You order the people to dismantle the ship and build a village around the temple. Its inhabitants are to serve and worship you. Each day, a few of them arrive with armfuls of fruit and fresh water and worship you. You could feed yourself, with the power to attract food, but you prefer to be served. It gives you satisfaction. First you were an insignificant worker, then a slave, and now they treat you like a deity. Sometimes, however, you wonder if you have really achieved anything. You are a powerful mage, but at the same time a blind man chained to a throne. Your power is limited to a dozen intimidated people and your pleasures are limited to a full belly. But as you contemplate this, another delegation arrives. The sight of men groveling before you makes your doubts disappear for a time.
