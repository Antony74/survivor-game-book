The necromancer hands you a water tankard. While you quench your thirst, he says: 
"Unfortunately, I only have one camel, but I have to go slowly anyway, so I trust you can keep up with me. I invite you to be my guest." 
You head west. Along the way you tell of the Kazraits attack. After a day's travel, you arrive at a salt marsh with a tall tower sticking out of it. This is the home of the sorcerer, who introduced himself to you by the name of Kemosz. It's a good thing this is the end of the road, because the living dead are already starting to stink. The necromancer hosts you with a modest meal. You see that the shelves are cluttered with books - scrolls in tubes and loose, tablets of stone and clay, and strange boxes created from wood and stitched cards. Too bad you can't read. 
Then the necromancer gets to work. Out of gratitude you help him, although the job is not very pleasant. The necromancer embalms his reanimates with various herbs and solutions, as well as different spells. He also tells stories - about the history of black magic, about necromancers who lived for hundreds of years and ruled entire countries with their armies of undead, about the energies of life and death... and also about the amusing case of a undead who fell into a manure pit. 
You finish the job. The new undead are protected from rotting, and the corpse odor is masked by the scent of herbs and potions. As you wash your hands, Kemosh declares: 
"We did pretty well. I have a proposition for you. Would you like to be my apprentice? It's a tradition, or superstition, if you will... but often the best necromancers are people who have lost everything and everyone in some tragedy. And you may be the only survivor of the Szarleh massacre. Think about it."
I have nowhere to go. I don't want to keep running, I don't want to be weak. I want power and knowledge. I am ready (page 35). 
Thank you, but I'm not fit to be a necromancer. I'll go my own way (page 21).
