You try to limit preying on people. You organize seizures less often, you suck out life less often. You take just enough to stave off disease and aging. You resume your studies. You look for ways to negate the risk of addiction and negative side effects. You also follow another thread - it is rumored that some ancient necromancers were able to use the energy they gained to heal not only themselves, but others as well. If you mastered this art, you could change the face of necromancy, get back at people, gain their respect and gratitude. And as time goes on, you miss human company more and more. The undead make poor companions. You could use an apprentice. But how do you find one? You can't just walk into the middle of some village and ask if anyone would like to become a necromancer. You might spend the next few years alone before a good opportunity comes along.
