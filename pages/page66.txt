The guards lead you to the Ogabad House, not much smaller than a royal palace. Inside is full of carvings, the walls are decorated with mosaics, and the floors are carpeted. Sitting on cushions are Narfeli and her friends. The merchant's daughter is moderately pretty - black thick curly hair are framing a rather uninteresting face. 
- The sword master has visited us! - announces Narfeli. - Master, show us your skills! 
You start talking about your most famous fights, using a wooden sword to demonstrate the blows. Then it's time for another demonstration. You lie down on the carpet and begin to raise and lower yourself on your hands. You promise the girls that you will hit two hundred repetitions. To increase the difficulty, you ask one of them to sit on your back. The young women loudly count each successive lift. Everything takes place under the watchful eyes of the guards who are supposed to guard the safety - and virtue - of the assembled girls. 
You're hitting two hundred. You are tired, dripping with sweat. One of the guards escorts you to the bathhouse, where you wash up a bit, then return to the main chamber to entertain the jubilant and her friends with conversation and the sight of your chest. 
I try to entertain all the ladies equally (page 5). 
I turn my attention primarily to the hostess (page 69).
