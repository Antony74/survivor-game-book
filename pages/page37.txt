You devote yourself to study. You look through all the books Kemosz has collected that you haven't had time to read before. You find enigmatic references to "the flow of life energy" or "life stealing". You begin to look further. You travel around the world, searching through different book collections. You read the inscriptions on the walls of ruined temples of forgotten gods. You talk to priests, shamans, and sorcerers. From the shards of knowledge a picture emerges. You rediscover a forgotten life-sucking technique by which a necromancer can drain another person's vitality and enhance his own. You return to the tower and begin organizing attacks using the undead anew. But you don't turn captives into new reanimates. You suck the life out of them. You feel the surge of power every time. It's a wonderful, amazing feeling. But you notice something disturbing. Over time, you completely lose your appetite for normal food, but your hunger for life force becomes stronger and stronger. This coincides with some references you've come across during your research. Some ancient necromancers became completely addicted to sucking out life over time. They needed more and more. They lived to be hundreds of years old, but at the cost of becoming monsters possessed by a supernatural hunger. If you follow this path, it will not be enough to absorb the life force of a desert robber once in a while. You will have to... ...To expand your foraging range. The question is, do you want to follow this path? 
Yes, the only thing that matters is the wonderful feeling when I am filled with energy. I'm gonna live forever (page 49)! 
No. I must restrain myself while there is time (page 45).
