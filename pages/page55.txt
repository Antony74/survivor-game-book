You stand quietly on the rise, waiting for your turn. Finally, a mercenary pushes his way to the middle, and the trader begins to praise: 
- Here is a master of all crafts! You could say he was born with a hammer and a saw in his hands. He will build anything, repair anything. A valuable asset in every home and workshop. Let's start the bidding, who will give more? 
The congregants begin to give totals. The auction is not too fierce and soon ends. Your new owner becomes a mulleted, middle-aged man. The trader's men tie your hands and hand the end of the rope to your master. Together you squeeze through the crowd. You still make no attempt to escape. You spot a couple of city guards; they would probably catch you quickly. 
The owner leads you to a place where a horse-drawn cart stands. An elderly, balding man is standing on the cart and he is improving some package. At the sight of you he jumps down from the cart and nods. 
- I have bought what I need, master - he declares. - As far as I'm concerned, we're good to go. 
- I also bought what I needed - says the owner. - And yes, we can go. 
The master seats himself on the cart, indicating to you the seat next to him. An old servant drives. You move toward the city gates. 
- My name is Hradesz, and I am your new master - declares the swarthy-haired man. - As you can guess, you will have to work for me. First, a question: are you really a master craftsman? Could you fix, say, a potter's wheel? 
I was just a simple worker. I don't know the mechanics (page 47). 
Of course, master. I know all about it. And everything. I'll repair it in no time. (Page 29).
