You take the postion of royal guard centurion. It's more quiet job. Y ou are in charge of organizing the drill exercises, setting up guards, running parades anf punishing of offenses. Food is good, and bed in your room is comfortable. The king can be sometimes a bit capricious, but not cruel, and highest commander of guard is reasonable man. But it doesn't mean that everyone is glad with thier rule. 
One day you are invited to a metting with Great Vizier. When you go to his chamber, you meet there overseer of the royal stables and grest treasurer too. 
- Greetings, centurion – says vizier, pointing you to the seat next to him. - We gathered here to discuss important matter. Our current king is lazy and reckless. We have to replace him by a better ruler – she declares, stroking his second chin. - It would be beneficial for you to participate in our plot. As foreigner and former slave you will never be promoted above the centurion, you will never become supreme commander... Unless a king favorable to you take the throne. So? Are you with us? 
Of these dignitaries, only the equestrian has combat experience, but there is three of them, and each of them has knife by belt. You can't simply refuse them, or they'll silence you forever. But you can pretend you agree to take part in their conspiracy. Unless you really want to participate. 
I sincerely agree with a vizier (page 11). 
I pretend to join the plot, but as soon as I can, I will tell about it my commander (page 36).
