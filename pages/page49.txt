With time, you start attacking not only brigands, slavers and Kazraitis, but also ordinary merchants and travelers roaming the desert. Soon, people don't go near your tower at all. You start raiding remote villages with your reanimated creatures. The unfortunate villagers become a source of vitality for you. You suck them dry and discard them like useless shells. 
Your actions attract the attention of King Bashar, who organizes an expedition against you. Soldiers burst into the tower, destroy the animated creatures and your book collection, and set fire to the building. But they don't get you alone. During the raid you are in another village, massacring its inhabitants. You lose your army and your home. But you don't care anymore. Under the cover of night (the sun's rays have been scorching and blinding you for some time), you wander the country, from one settlement to another. You strike out of the darkness, killing individual people and then leaving before the local authorities get on your trail. The years pass, you don't count them, but with each passing year, you become less and less human. When you peer into a puddle, you see red eyes and cadaverous skin. You are a predator, a beast, and in your mind there is only room for lust for other people's life energy and animal cunning, which allows you to hunt down your prey.
