You hide further in the bushes. You follow the pirates. They find a spring with water, but luckily they don't notice your hut. They fill the barrel with water, pick fruit and return to the ship. Once it is safe, you go out onto the beach. You watch the sail disappearing on the horizon. You are left alone again. You regret a little. Such an opportunity may not come again, this island is off the beaten track. But those pirates might have taken you prisoner, they might also use slaves as rowers. You'd rather die than become a galley boy again. But you won't die. At least not for now. You have your spring and your fruit, you can live here for many more years... If you don't go crazy before then.
