As your undead troops march through the streets of Hier Kazreal, terrified citizens take cover in their homes. Occasionally, you catch a glimpse of a fearful face peering through a window. 
You reach the temple. But you cannot enter it. You are hindered by the presence you sense there. You are not a good person, but nothing you have encountered while studying dark magic can compare to this evil. You sense the essence of pure selfishness, absolute pride, jealousy and hatred. It makes you nauseous. You can't go in there, you can't send your servants in there. 
From behind the column at the entrance sticks out a head with a gold cap on it. 
- Ha! - you hear a voice. - You can't come in here, you filthy sorcerer! You and your deeds are an abomination before the face of the Unspeakable One! This place is washed with the blood of sacrifices made in his name, filled with his omnipotence! 
You ponder for a moment, and then you order the undeads to gather all the wood from the area and spread it around the temple. Then you start a fire. Soon the shrine is surrounded by a ring of fire. The undead pull out burning boards and, ignoring the burns, throw them inside the building. The priests flinch, trying to put out the fire, but soon the temple is filled with fire. 
You leave the burning building and order the march out of the city. Let the Kazraites try to save their shrine - they will not succeed anyway. You hope that the cult of the Unspeakable will not recover from this blow. 
As you move slightly away from the city walls, you remove the spell from most of the reanimated men who fall to the desert sand. Controlling such a large army has exhausted your body and soul. You return to your tower, rest a bit... and then you will consider your next plans. 
THE END
