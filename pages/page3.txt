You grab the Zabulon's robe, you turn the man i and regardless of his protests , you kick him in ass. Prohpet falls forward and falls out from inner sanctum. Your people lash out. Archpriest gets battered, kicked, spat on, mocked and then tied. 
Zabulon is not your slave for long. One of kings who command alliance buy priest from you for many coins and makes him his jester. During victory parade Zabulon has painted face and clothes made form colourful patches. Soldier jerks him with a spear and forces him doing flips. 
You didnt't sell Prophet's crown. You bringed it to ruin of Szarleh and trod on in front of the Star Pyramid. You hope, that this simple ritual will appease shadows of your murdered compatriots. 
Thank to the loot and payment for Zabulon you became rich man. You end carrier of mercenary, buy estate, you hire servants and workers. Maybe in a while you will think about wife. Or wifes. 
THE END
