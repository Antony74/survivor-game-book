You grab the Zabulon's robe, You turn the man i and  regardless of his protests , You kick him in 
ass. Prohpet falls forward and falls out from inner sanctum. Your people lash out. Archpriest  gets 
battered, kicked, spat on, mocked and then tied. 
Zabulon is not Your slave for long. One of kings who command alliance buy priest from You for 
many coins and makes him his jester. During victory parade Zabulon has painted face and clothes made 
form colourful patches. Soldier  jerks him with a spear and forces him doing flips. 
You didnt't sell Prophet's crown. You bringed it to ruin of Szarleh and  trod on in front of the Star 
Pyramid. You hope, that this simple ritual will appease shadows of Your murdered compatriots.  
Thank to the loot and payment for Zabulon You became rich man. You end carrier of mercenary, 
buy estate, You hire servants and workers. Maybe in a while You will think about wife. Or wifes. 
THE END
