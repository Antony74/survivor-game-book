- Too bad. In that case, I wish you luck - replies Aszakar. 
Several mercenary units have their home in Baszar. You visit the quarters of one of them, called the Swords of the Sun. With your fame, they accept you on the spot. 
And so begins the next phase of your life. You learn to fight in close formation and march to the beat of a drum. Sometimes you escort a caravan or protect a rich man, and sometimes you take part in great battles and sieges. Your sword drinks the blood of many new victims. Sometimes you starve in a besieged city, dreaming of catching a rat, and sometimes you feast on expensive wines in the cellar of a defeated ruler. You work your way up the career ladder, becoming first a decurion, and then one of three centurions. 
Age is slowly taking its toll on you. Walking all day makes your muscles hurt and your movements become slower in battle. You begin to think about finding a quieter way to live. Soon, an opportunity presents itself. The company commander makes a deal with the rulers of a coalition of cities planning war against the Kazraites, but one of your comrades-in-arms tells you that the King of Baszar is planning to expand the palace guard. 
- He will definitely take an experienced warrior like you - your friend declares. 
No, I will not let the opportunity for revenge against the Kazraiths slip through my hands (page 30)! 
Palace life will be a nice change (page 7).
