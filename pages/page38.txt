With the money you accumulate, you buy a pair of camels, bales of canvas, hire helpers, and hit the road. You cross the desert on your way to another city. As you wipe the sweat from your forehead and complain about your butt getting sores from sitting on a camel (not that the corns from walking are any better), you begin to wonder if this is really better than gladiatorial training. 
But you cheer up when you sell goods locally and earn a round sum. You purchase spices and raisins and return to Bashar, earning again. And so it goes. Sometimes, when the caravan is attacked by desert ruffians, you fend off their attacks - something left over from your gladiatorial years. 
You make a small fortune in trade. You become a respected merchant. And the feasts you organize become more and more famous every day.
