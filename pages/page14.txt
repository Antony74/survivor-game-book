You buck up and jum into the crowd. Tou start to jostle between people. You get different reactions. One woman screams out in fear, another scarred man laughs in your face. A nipper lower than you by a head tries to tug at your hand, probably in the hope of getting a reward for arresting a fugitive, but you push him aside. But at some point you come across an armed man wearing a helmet and a breastplate. Perhaps city guard? The man in this crowd cannot use his spear, but he starts tussle with you. It's not the same as the handle of a bleak street urchin, it isnt' easy to free yourself from his embrace. You feel hot breath and saliva droplets on your face.
