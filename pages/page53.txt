You continue to indulge in entertainment. Until now you were known for your accomplishments in the arena, now you are famous for the feasts you organize. Women still chase you... though for some reason your circle of admirers has gradually dwindled over time. 
Eventually you realize that drinking and eating make some of your muscles turn into fat. Besides, all these pleasures simply make you lazy. You don't want to practice fencing every day, let alone risk your life in the arena. You tell Aszakar to choose less dangerous opponents, preferably ones without experience. The fight organizer is unhappy, but agrees to this arrangement. At first the spectators continue to come to your fights, the fame of the sword master has the power of attraction. But over time they become less and less popular. Most people get tired of watching you hit sword against sword with some novice. One day an upset Aszakar declares that if this keeps up, he'll stop organizing fights involving you at all, they'll just stop paying off. And when the cash flow stops, the pleasures will also stop. 
You're trying to get back into shape, but it's probably too late. You're not a young man anymore and you're struggling to regain your old musculature and agility. It will be a long time before you can try to compete against the best again. Assuming you succeed at all, you will be out of the public eye by the time you do. No, your days of gladiatorial glory are over. You have to know when to leave the stage... and think of a way to secure your future. 
I may not be an active fighter anymore, but I have accumulated a lot of experience. I can train others (page 24). 
As long as I still have some gold, I need to invest (strona 39).
