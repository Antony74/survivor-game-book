You grab a wooden rod. Meanwhile, people have started to move away from you. Not enough for you to take a full swing, but you are able to stab the guard in the face. Unfortunately, you don't manage to hit the eye as you intended, but the spearhead plows a wound into the armed man's cheek. The man screams, while simultaneously pulling a knife from behind his belt. He makes a thrust. You block it with your spear, but immediately the guard cuts you across the stomach. The cut is superficial, but the pain stuns you for a moment. At this time, two more guards push through the crowd. The three of them disarm you and knock you to the ground. 
- Cursed! - you hear a voice. You manage to raise your head enough to see the fat slave trader. - I'll have to pay a fine because of you! 
- I will pay it - you hear another voice. It comes from behind you, and one of the guards is squeezing you, so you can't turn around. - The fine and the purchase price. I like this slave. He's got a fighting spirit. He'll make a good gladiator. 
- Oh, noble sir, I assure you he will! - He's a trader again. - He's an experienced warrior. He was a Szarlehic soldier. 
The guards allow you to stand up and then you see your new owner. He is a tall, thin, but muscular man with one eye covered by a blindfold. He handcuffs you and leads you toward a large circular building. 
- This is the famous gladiator school and arena of Aszakar. That's.... mine - he declares, leading you into the building's basement. - Your new home. Like everyone else, I offer fair terms to motivate you to fight and give you courage. When you defeat three hundred opponents - not at once, of course - you will be free. 
And so you find yourself in gladiator school. When the wound on your stomach heals, you begin your training. For the first few days it's just physical exercises for fitness, strength and agility, and pretend fights with wooden swords. You fail to make friends with the warriors you fight. Each of them knows that in a while you may end his life. 
The moment is approaching when you go out into the arena and begin a career as a gladiator. The life of most representatives of this profession ends quickly and bloodily, but for some it is a path to fame. If you want to belong to the latter type, you should think about what kind of gladiator you want to be and how you want to gain the applause of the crowds. 
I will be a terryfying, merciless killer (page 22). 
I will be charming, stylish fencer (page 63). 
I doesn't want to be a gladiator at all. I am not planing to murder for the admiration of a bloodthirsty mob (page 42).
