You go into town. At the gate, the guards tell you to pull up your shirt to check for signs of illness. You walk through the streets. You pass a cart with the bodies of the dead pulled by a gravedigger. You reach the Temple of Wisdom and meet the scribe. He doesn't want to leave the shrine, you have to bribe him. The scribe is counting too well, he would like to get most of your silver! A long moment passes before you manage to negotiate a lower price. 
Together you head to the farm, but arrive too late. Hradesz lies on the bed, staring at the ceiling with dead eyes. 
- I have come in vain! - The scribe is annoyed, as if he had not taken his wages in advance. - Although... Perhaps not. This man's heirs will have to be established. 
Hradesz had no relatives, nor did he leave a will. In this situation, ownership of the land passes to the king of the town. The monarch makes one of his courtiers the tenant, and the tenant brings in slaves who will work there. He does not need a free worker to be paid. 
You are without a home and you set out into the world to seek your fortune. Fortunately, you don't start with nothing - you have half of the silver taken from the stove in your pocket. You've been in worse trouble before, so it'll be fine. Maybe.
