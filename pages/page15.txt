Strona 15
 
You are still a gladitor, but now as free man. Much more unfortunates still die under the blows of your sword. Your fame goes beyond the borders of Bashar and froma another cities arrive swordmasters to face You, but none of them can overcome your strength, fury and cruelty. 
As a freedman, You can fully enjoy the fruits of your victories. Between fights You drink expensive wines, eat tidbits and spend time with concubines. But You start wondering if all this entertainmers are not making You too... Soft. Slow. Weak. 
I only live once! I will not give up entertainment. I just will be choosing wekar enemies (page 19). 
End with this, it's time to straighten myself up. I am a warrior, not a lothario (page 28).
