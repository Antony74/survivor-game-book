- Whatever - the warrior says, spitting into the street, and then walks away. You finally manage to find a job. You will be helping to build the estate of a rich merchant.

You work hard and make a good impression, so you become a permanent member of the bricklaying crew. You rent a corner to sleep in, have something to eat and something to put on your back.
