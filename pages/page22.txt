Finally, you step out into the arena. You are greeted by the cheers of the crowds gathered in the stands and the sight of your opponent with his sword bare. You finish your first fight by slashing your enemy's head, and then, covered in his blood, you cut off his head and present it to the audience. Subsequent fights are similar. Thrill-seekers flock to your fights to watch you rip out guts, cut off heads and limbs and mercilessly slaughter wounded opponents. Other gladiators prefer to be part of your team during group fights... or rather, they try not to be part of the team that is about to face you. People call you "The Slayer." 
You carefully count your fallen foes. On the day you triumph over the enemy for the three hundredth time, Aszakar turns to you: 
- I keep my word. I have earned you with a considerable allowance. As of today, you are a free man. But I have a proposition for you. Remain a gladiator. You've made a name for yourself, people want to see you. Don't waste it. You'll share in the profits! 
I agree (page 15). 
No, I'm tired of being made a freak. I'll use my combat experience in another way. I'll become a mercenary (page 26).
