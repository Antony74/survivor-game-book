You agree to join the conspiracy and even take an oath of allegiance to the grand vizier. When the meeting ends, you do not immediately run to your commander, in case the grand vizier's men are watching you. It is not until two days later, while talking to your commander about the new guard schedule, that you surreptitiously sneak up to him and whisper the bad news in his ear. The commander's eyes widen, but he says nothing. That night all the conspirators are dragged from their beds before the king. 
- You planned my death! How dare you! Your punishment will be terrible! - Shouts the ruler. - Thank the gods, there are still loyal people among my subjects! 
The king orders you and the commander-in-chief to step forward. As a token of gratitude, he grants each of you a small estate outside the city. You see the vizier and his henchmen frothing at the sight, but all they can do is cast you murderous glances. 
The next day, the king orders one of the wooden elevations in the town square to be occupied and an instrument of torture from the palace dungeon to be set up there. For the next week there is a festival of fingernail pulling, eye gouging and quartering. Such is the fate of traitors. 
 And you? From now on, you occasionally relax in the shade of the trees at your new property. You may not have become commander-in-chief, but it's still good. Besides, who knows? Everything is still ahead of you. 
THE END
