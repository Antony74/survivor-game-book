- You can't touch me! - Shouts Zabulon. His expressions of indignation turn into shrieks of pain 
As you deliver the first cut. The prophet tries to flee, struggling and throwing a golden bowl off the 
Altar, which falls to the floor with a clatter, but you are merciless. In a rage you chop the priest to 
Pieces. As you finish, your hand with the bloodied sword falls. You see your comrades in arms standing 
Around you, making big eyes. This butchery has impressed even these seasoned veterans. 
After the war, you take Zabulon's skull to the ruins of Sharleh. You place it in front of the Great 
Pyramid, then crush it with a hammer and trample the remains. Now you can live with the knowledge 
That vengeance has been exacted, and the spirits of the Szarlehites can rest in peace. 
Being called "the man who killed the Prophet" made you even more famous. After your 
Commander died, you became the new leader of the Swords of the Sun. Powerful people hire you when 
They want to destroy someone completely. You have amassed a considerable fortune, though your 
Greatest joy is on the battlefield, when battle rages in your head and heart.
