You grab light axe, which you were using to chopping wood and small reapirs and you run out. You see invader leaning over old man with sabre ready to slash. Y ou run up to foreigner from behind and you stick the axe blade in his back. Enemy shouts terribly and releases the weapon. You wrench your blade from his body, you are splattered with his blood. Enemy falls dead and old man rise his head and starts praising gods. You try ask him to serach hideout, but he only cry his prayers. 
A while later troop of man-at-arms comes around the corner. Fortunately, they are Sharlehits. Their head is man, who wears decurion's helmet with plume. He is accompanied by eight people, few king's soldiers with leather armours and swords, but also few citizens likes Yu, armed with knifes, clubs and axes. 
- Come with us! - Orders decurion. You have no choice, so you comply. You leave old man and go to fight. When you march behind one of men-at-arms, you hear him muttering “Let teh Abbyss take the Kazraits”. So invaders are Kazraits... This news chills the blood of your veins. It is infamous nation who despises all other tribes and is fanatically devoted to its cruel god, The Unspeakable One. They are known for the fact they kill every living being, even animals, in cities they conquer. 
You walk teh streets with small troop. You clash with each encountered enemy. Every once in a while one of your companions die, sometimes new Szarlehita capable of fighting join you. At first you wonder if decurion have any specific plan or if he only want to die in battle, previously killing as many enemies, as he can. But later you stop thinking. You fall into the trance, there is only fire, blood and screams of dying people. 
At one point your troop stumbles upon big group of Kazraits. Above their heads rises banner with octagon – you heard that The Unspeakable One hates images of humans and animals. Enemies raise a battle cry and attack. You fight bravely, but they puch you back more and more. Every moment one of Szarlehits fall in the battle.You don't panic, you saw too much gore this night. Your axe rises and falls, cracking the skulls. In the end, your commander becomes victim of Kazrait's sabre. When his helmet with plume falls to the ground, you freeze for a moment. That's enough for you to rbe hit by a club. Darkness falls. 
You wake up with terrible headache. When you open your eyes, it's bright day. There is several dozen... Maybe hundred people standing around you. Old ones, young ones, mothers with little children. Many of them are hurt or burned. You are on Great Plaza infront of the Star Pyramid. Over heads of your companions you see that in front of the ziggurat there is stake with crowned head. You recognize thi face and insignia – it's Mage-King. You see also that you are surrounded by Kazrainian warriors. Whenever one of Szarlehits moves to guardianms and try beg them for mercy, they jerk him with spears and herd him back. 
You see two exceptional invaders. They both wear pointed tiara, but cap and dress of one of them is embroidered with gold. 
- We should exterminate them all and purge this land from infeidels. This is the most merciful will of  The Unspeakable One! - Screams poorer invader, man with slim, triangular face. His voice voice breaks over the moans of your compatriots. 
- I am the Prophet and  The Unspeakable One anounce his holy will through me – answers Kazrait in golden dress. - And now he revealed to me that Great Altar must be decorated with eight precious stones of eight kinds, to symbolize eight priestly dynasties. We must buy them. And because of it, this slaves will be sold on the market. Do you question my words, Zabulon? 
- I wouldn't dare, Ptopeht – answers second priest, retreating into the crowd o Kazraits. 
- Nie śmiałbym, Proroku – odpowiada drugi kapłan, wycofując się w tłum Kazraitów. 
- So... - Continues the Prophet. - Soldiers! Kill too young or too old ones! Tether and lead the rest for slave market in Baszar!
