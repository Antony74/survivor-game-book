You prefer to stay away from this suspicious pyramid. It looks like a cursed place. You build yourself a hut from pieces of ship cast ashore and branches. You eat fruit and drink water from a spring. Somehow you make a living, although you lose a lot of weight on this diet. You dream of a piece of meat or at least goat cheese. And then there is this boredom. Before, you were not aware of its existence. As a laborer you worked hard all day long, every moment of rest was awaited. And as a galley worker - you know. And now you have nothing to do all day long. You start to go crazy from it. Every now and then you catch yourself thinking out loud, or even talking to yourself. At times, you wonder if you should enter a temple after all. Even if evil spirits live there, it would always be a change. 
At first you try to keep track of the days using notches in the tree, but soon you lose count. But about a year passes when a ship arrives on the island. Several sailors come ashore. Maybe it's paranoia, but something tells you not to reveal yourself right away. From behind the bushes you peer at the newcomers. They look like rough killers. They have knives in their belts, and you can see scar marks on their arms and faces. 
- But damn it, the captain is a greedy bastard and unjust one - you hear one of them say. - He didn't divide the loot from the last ship equally at all. 
- He took more because it was his captain's right - answers his black companion. - And Hekker got a double share because he killed that captain. Don't talk, just look for water and something to eat. 
They are pirates! The question is, do you want to expose yourself to such scoundrels? 
Yes, I'm tired of being alone, let them do what they want with me (page 59). 
No, they'll make me a slave again, I can't stand it (page 52).
