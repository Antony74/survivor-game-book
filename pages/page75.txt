You give up fighting in the arena. But you've gotten so used to doing swordplay that you can't do anything else at the moment. Ogobad tries to get you into the family business, but you have no head for it, so he finally gives up. Fortunately, you find another occupation. You become a fencing teacher. Rich people, aristocrats and courtiers pay you to teach them the art of the blade. In time, you begin to take your son with you to your lessons, so that together you can demonstrate proper techniques. The boy is happy to show off his skills.
