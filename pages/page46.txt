You go inside and walk down a short hallway. The feeling of vibration intensifies, your head starts to hurt a little. Probably this building is suitable for a dormitory after all. 
You are in a hall, in the middle of which stands a throne made of the same dark material that the building is made of. Anyway, you get the impression that it is part of the building, you can't see the gap between one and the other. On the seat is a skeleton. You tense up for a moment, ready to run away, but it's a regular dead skeleton, not a wraith of any kind. On its head is a helmet. Oddly enough, there are no eyeholes. Next to the throne is a rise, on which is some sort of bowl and some sort of bottle. All made of this black substance. 
You notice that some red symbols have been painted on the wall. You look at them, they are very precise and detailed. A human figure holding a knife, you can see mouth and eyes on a circle forming a head. The figure is drinking from a bottle. A figure sticks a knife in his eye. Eyeless figure with bloody streaks on face. A figure holding a helmet over his head. A figure sitting on a throne, wearing a helmet, surrounded by rays spreading out over all sides. What kind of crazy ritual is this? Is this how the corpse on the throne died? Did he gouge out his eyes and collapse from pain and blood loss? Or is there really some magic at work here? What do you have to lose altogether? 
I'm not crazy. I'm leaving this place and never coming back (page 8). 
I will follow the paintings instruction. If there is a power at work here, I will possess it (page 50).
