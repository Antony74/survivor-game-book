Enthusiasm does not leave your spouse during the wedding night. In the morning, you are as exhausted as you were after strenuous exercise or a fight. 
You enter the Ogabad family. You and Narfeli are far ahead in the line of succession - the merchant has three sons. Were it not for that, he would probably never have agreed to this misalliance. Nevertheless, the favor the merchant shows his only daughter causes him to initiate you into the family business. Your new life is quieter and more comfortable than your gladiatorial days, but that doesn't mean you spend your days lying on the sofa drinking wine. You may find yourself traveling with trade caravans. Most of your travels are peaceful, but on a few occasions you have dipped your sword in the blood of highwaymen. Thanks to that you don't get out of practice.
