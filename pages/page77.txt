The guards lead you to the Ogabad House, not much smaller than a royal palace. Inside is full of carvings, the walls are decorated with mosaics, and the floors are carpeted. Sitting on cushions are Narfeli and her friends. The merchant's daughter is moderately pretty - black thick curly hair are framing a rather uninteresting face. 
- The sword master has visited us! - Announces Narfeli. - Master, show us your skills! 
You begin to recount your most famous fights, using a wooden sword to demonstrate the blows. Meanwhile, the servants serve the meal on low tables. A knife lies between the dishes. It looks sharp. You grab it and leap at Narfela, putting the blade to her throat. The guards move toward you, but you shout that if they don't stand, you will slit the girl's throat. The jubilant's friends start squealing shrilly, but the merchant's daughter herself is excited rather than terrified. 
- Adventure! - She shouts. - Will you take me to your secret rogue hideout? 
You step through the hallway of the mansion. You hear footsteps, but far behind you. You are about to scream for them to stop following you, but then you feel something poke you in the back. The pain is so great that you let go of Narfeli. You still manage to spin backwards. You see an armed man with a bow, just about to apply another arrow. A moment later, a second bullet slams into your body. You fall to your knees, and moments later, on your face. You are dying.
