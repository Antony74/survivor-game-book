You emerge from the bushes. The pirates first grab their weapons, but you convince them that you are not dangerous. After a quick discussion, they order you to lead them to a spring with water. They fill a barrel and charge you with it, then lead you to the ship. 
You stand before the captain, a stocky man with a split black beard. He listens to your story and then declares: 
- You broke out of slavery, you survived a shipwreck, you survived a year on your own. The gods must love you. You will become one of us and bring us luck! 
- I don't think he brought luck to the previous crew - mutters one of the pirates under his breath, but so that the leader doesn't hear. 
And so begins your life as a sea robber. Soon you gain some flesh, get your hands on a cutlass and take part in a raid on the first ship. You kill one of the sailors with your own hands. You feel some remorse as you look at the deck covered in blood and corpses. You didn't want to murder for the crowd's applause, now you murder for money. 
- Come below deck, the captain will share the spoils! - Your companion pats you on the shoulder. - I hear they found jewels in the hold! 
But you will get used to it somehow.
