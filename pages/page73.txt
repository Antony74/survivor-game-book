- Ah yes. The groom is polite, but not very helpful - says the courtier. He throws a few more insults at you, but seeing that you are not impressed, he finally gives up. 
Finally, the time comes for the bedding. To the accompaniment of toasts, you and Narfeli leave the main hall. 
- Why did you let yourself be talked down to by that little prick? - asks Narfeli with disappointment written all over her face. But when you get to bed, your wife is filled with enthusiasm. In the morning you are as exhausted as you would be after a hard exercise or a fight. 
You enter the Ogabad family. You and Narfeli are far ahead in the line of succession - the merchant has three sons. Were it not for that, he would probably never have agreed to this misalliance. Nevertheless, the favor the merchant shows his only daughter causes him to initiate you into the family business. Your new life is quieter and more comfortable than your gladiatorial days, but that doesn't mean you spend your days lying on the sofa drinking wine. You may find yourself traveling with trade caravans. Most of your travels are peaceful, but on a few occasions you have dipped your sword in the blood of bandits. Thanks to that you don't get out of practice.
