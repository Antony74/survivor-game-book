- An honest answer. - Hradesz nods his head. - This is what I expected, to tell you the truth. Merchants are always exaggerating. 
You leave the city. Bashar is surrounded by fertile lands with farms. Along the way you pass a couple of such farms. You see people working in the fields. Is this what your life will be like now? Somehow you will survive, as long as Hradesh feeds you well and rarely beats you. 
In the meantime, the owner questions you about your past. You don't have much to say, your life has been pretty uninteresting so far... And about the conquest of Szarleh you don't feel like talking. However, you try to give a matter-of-fact answer, so as not to upset Hradesz. 
Eventually you pull up to your new master's farm. You are met by a petite gray-haired woman and a stocky man about your age. 
- This is your new helper - Hradesz declares. - For now he will sleep in the barn. Work honestly and I will treat you well and one day you will gain your freedom - he says to you. 
You are soon introduced to the other servants. Khilosh and Renel - The older couple were slaves to Hradesh's parents. They practically helped raise him, so when he inherited them after the death of his mother and father, he was immediately freed. Their son, Gralen, was born already a free man. 
And so life goes on. You help with the farm chores, plowing the field, sowing the grain, harvesting the crops. You take care of repairs. Hradesz treats you pretty well. Only once did the stick go out when you forgot to gather the hay and the rains wet it. You no longer sleep in the barn, Renel has prepared a bed for you at home. 
Three years pass. One night you are awakened by a noise. You get up and move to the main room. You cautiously look out from behind the ajar door. The other household members are already there. Gralen is holding an axe, Hradesz a knife. Across from them stand three sturdy men armed with clubs and knives. 
- Tell me where you have hidden the silver! - Growls one of them. 
- There are guards from the city patrolling this area at night, they will be here soon - Hradesz declares in a calm tone. 
- Soon, will be dead! - Replies the thug, taking a step forward and brandishing a knife. 
The bandits throw themselves at Hradesz and Gralen. Renel wails, holding his head, and Chilosz runs around. You look around you. You don't have any weapons in hand. 
I'm moving in to help (page 60)! 
I owe them nothing, I will not risk my life for my oppressor (page 39).
