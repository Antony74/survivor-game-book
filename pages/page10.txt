Kazrainians soldiers tear children away from their mothers and catch the infirm old people, later they murder them all. Regardless of the laments of the survivors, they put you in columns and bind your hands. Few hours later they start to drive you out of the city and further east through the desert. The road is a torture. Because You are tied ano to another, walking is hard, especially when someone misses the beat. The sun is scorching and You get water only once a day. When someone falls as a result of tripping or fatigue, merciless Kazraits are hitting him with sticks. 
After four days You arrive to the slave market in Baszar. Kazraits overcome their aversion to the infidels nad sell Your group to the merchant, bearded man. You are in his might now and you are untied so that you can be sold one by one. But guardians hired by the merchant watch You, so that none of You run away. Every moment one of Szarlehits goes to a wooden platform, whre the trader is praising his advantages. According to his words, every second man is titan of work and master craftsmanship , and each women â€“ concubine form harem of Mage-King, which he had not time to deflower. 
Speaking of concubines... At one point a guard standing next to You starts to watch carefully one of Szarleh young girls. He undresses her with his eyes, not paying attention to anything that is going on around. There is a crowd in the marketplace that you can blend in with. Maybe it is your chance for escape?
