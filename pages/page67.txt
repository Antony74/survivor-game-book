You increase the number of attacks, and with each battle your army of the dead grows in number. You already have hundreds of them, they don't fit in the tower and when not skirmishing, they stand in even ranks behind the building. You start carrying out raids on Kazraiz border villages. Again, each time you turn the fallen into new undead. You already have a sizable army at your disposal. You can't hide, especially since the Kazrai Prophet has sent an army against you. A battle takes place in the desert. Hosts of dead men clash with followers of the Unspeakable. The living soldiers are fitter, sharper and better armed than the reanimated ones, but you have black magic on your side. You are in a trance and constantly maintain a spell that causes every fallen Kazraite to join your undead. In this way, the scales of victory are slowly tipping in favor of your dead troops. Your servants surround your enemies and slaughter them to the ground. 
The road to Hier Kazrael, the enemy capital, is open. But the gates of the city itself are closed to you. You begin a siege. The reanimates form a ring around the walls. Most of them are not embalmed, so after a few days they begin to decompose. This causes a plague that infiltrates the city. You, as a necromancer are immune, but the plague kills and weakens many defenders. This allows you to capture the city. The reanimates crowd the gates until they manage to break them down and enter the city. 
You enter Hier Kazrael. You are filled with a sense of triumph, but also with a desire for revenge. Will you allow yourself to be carried away by it? 
The Kazraites have slaughtered many nations. The time has come for justice to be served. I will slaughter the townspeople and then deal with the rest of the Kazraitis (page 70). 
I am not as bloodthirsty as the Kazraites. I will break their power and humiliate their god, but I will not completely destroy their people (page 74).
