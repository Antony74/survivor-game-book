You close your eyes and give the undead a mental command, the same one the Kazraits have heard so many times from their prophets, "Kill everything that lives‚Äù. The undead crawl across the city. They enter every palace, every house, every hut. They find people - men, women and children - hiding in the nooks and crannies and bite them to pieces or tear them to shreds. The streets of Hier Kazrael run with blood. When night falls, there is not a single living soul in the city but you. You struggle to control your large army of undead, but you join the slaughter anyway. Then you direct your troops against the surrounding Kazraic villages and towns. Some of the inhabitants manage to escape, but many fall victim to your monsters. 
While you are clearing the land of the Kazraiths, several kings are forming an alliance against you and gathering a large army. Ungrateful people! You liberated the world from these bloodthirsty fanatics, why do they turn against you? 
A great battle ensues. The struggle lasts almost two days. When it is finally over, the battlefield is littered with masses of corpses that you do not have the strength to resurrect. In fact, you don't even have the strength to keep the majority of your own dead on their feet. You withdraw your will, and more than half your army falls to the ground. You must rest, prepare, make further plans... You will not leave it at that. You have found that humans cannot be trusted. At least most of them can't. You will find some disciples to help you control the army, and then you will begin to conquer the world. Peace will only come when your undead empire stretches from one end of the earth to the other!
