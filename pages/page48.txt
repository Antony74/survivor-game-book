- It's called spirit! I'm glad... Partner! - Aszakar says. The next day you talk to your future father- in-law and wife. Ogabad, an older man with sagging cheeks is unhappy with your life choice, but you are persistent. Fortunately, Nafreli helps you convince him. 
- I love my warrior! - She declares. - I will tremble for my him.... But I know he will prevail! 
Soon your wedding takes place at the Temple of Fertility. After the ceremony, the Ogabad throws a grand feast. Afterwards, you are treated to a wedding night during which Nafreli exhibits an indefatigable energy. 
You rest for a few days, and then you return to the arena. You triumph again. Although you are married, as in the past, maidens and matrons flock to your performances. They are not even discouraged by the fact that sometimes before a fight - and sometimes after, covered with your own blood and that of your opponents - you kiss your spouse. 
Years go by. Your son is born into the world. The boy grows like yeast, and you take care of his physical development. There comes a time when you start learning him fencing - with wooden sword, for now. One day your father-in-law calls you in for an interview. 
- That's enough! - He announces. - My grandson announced today that when he grows up, he wants to be a gladiator like you! I will not allow it. If he wants to fight, one day I'll give him a position in the royal army. And you can't set a bad example for him anymore! 
To tell you the truth, you started thinking about ending your career. The years are passing, old wounds are getting worse and your fitness is getting worse, although you still clash with younger opponents. 
Ogobad is right! No more arena (page 75). 
One last fight! I want to leave in style (page 12)!
