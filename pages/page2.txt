You are inhabitant of Szarleh, young worker. Your homeland is rich, so even humble man like 
You have has its share of well-being. You always have something to eat aand something to wear and 
place to sleep. Mage-king and his judges make sure that the rich do not exploit simpletons too much. 
You end another day of work, which You spend carrying bags with grain. You start Your way 
home. You pass streets decorated with garlands â€“ city prepare for Holiday of the Shortest Night, it's in 
two days. Samotimes You hear melodies played by musicians, who are practicing flutes and lutes 
before festivities. You arrive home and go to sleep. 
In tme middle on the night  You are awakened by screams. You look out the window and see the 
glow. Buildings are on fire, even Great Pyramid. People are running in the streets. You see a man in a 
turban grabbing your neighbor by the hair and cutting her throat with a curved saber. Another one is 
taking one-year child from home and beats his head against the wall. 
It's an invasion! You frantically wonder what to do. You are living near gate of Queen of 
Heaven, so You can try to escape from city. Or... maybe You will summon the courage and take part in 
fight, to protect Your home city? 
I will fight! (page 6).
