You are inhabitant of Szarleh - a young worker. Your homeland is rich, so even a humble man like 
you have a share of its well-being. You always have something to eat and something to wear and 
a place to sleep. The Mage-king and his judges make sure that the rich do not exploit ordinary folk too much. 
You end another day of work, which you have spent carrying bags of grain. You start your way 
home. You pass streets decorated with garlands â€“ the city is preparing for Holiday of the Shortest Night, it's in 
two days. Sometimes you hear melodies played by musicians, who are practicing flutes and lutes 
for the festivities. You arrive home and go to sleep. 
In the middle of the night you are awakened by screams. You look out the window and see the 
glow - buildings are on fire, even the Great Pyramid! People are running in the streets. You see a man in a 
turban grabbing your neighbor by the hair and cutting her throat with a curved saber. Another one is 
taking a one-year old child from his home and beating his head against the wall. 
It's an invasion! You frantically wonder what to do. You live near the Queen of 
Heaven gate, so you can try to escape from city. Or... maybe You will summon the courage and take part in 
fight, to protect your home city? 
I will fight! (page 6). 
I'll try to escape. (page 25).
