You grab Zabulon's robe, and turn the man - heedless of his protests, you kick him in ass. The Prophet falls forward and falls out of the inner sanctum. Your people lash out. The High Priest gets battered, kicked, spat on, mocked, and then tied. 
Zabulon is not your slave for long. One of kings who commands the alliance buys the priest from you for many coins and makes him his jester. During the victory parade Zabulon has his face painted and clothes made from colourful patches. A soldier jerks him with a spear and forces him to do flips. 
You didn't sell Prophet's crown. You brought it to the ruins of Szarleh and trod on it in front of the Star Pyramid. You hope that this simple ritual will appease the shadows of your murdered compatriots. 
Thanks to the loot and payment for Zabulon you became rich man. You end the career of a mercenary, buy an estate, and hire servants and workers. Maybe in a while you will take a wife. Or wives. 
THE END
