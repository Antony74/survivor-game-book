Strona 8
 
You leave this cursed place as soon as possible. Yo prefer to stay away form magic, especially magic, which demands sel-mutilation. Instead You plan to lead a simple life, as far as conditions permit. You build yourself a hut from stranded ashore pieces of ship and sticks. Youe eat fruits, You drink water from a pond. It's a living, although you lose a lot of weight on this board. Yopu dream about piece of meat or at least goat cheese. And this boredom. Before, You was not aware of its existence. As a worker You was toiling all days, so each moment of rest was precious. When You became galley slave, it was only worse. But now You don't have nothing to do. You are starting going crazy because of it. Every now and then you find yourself thinking out loud, or even talking to yourself, Sometimes You even wonder if it will be better if You go to the temple. 
At the start You are trying to follow the passage of days by doing cuts on the tree, but soon you lose track. But about a year passes, when a ship lands on an island. Several sailors come ashore. I tam be paranoia, but something tells You not to come out right away. You watch the newcomers from behind the bushes. They look like fierce warriors. Each have knife by belt, ant their faces and arms are covered by scars. 
- Damn it, our captain is avid crud and unjustful one – You hear, a one of them is speaking. - This loot from last ship – he didn't divide equally. 
- He took more, it's his captainsy right – answers his black-skinned companion. - And Hekker get double share, because he killed enemy captain. Don't talk, better serach water and something to eat. 
They're pirates! Do You want come out to scums like that? 
Yes! I am fed up with loneliness (page 59). 
No, they will make me slave again, I can't handle this (page 52).
