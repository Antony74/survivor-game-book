You continue to indulge in entertainment. You were previously known for your bloody feats in the arena, but now you are famous for the feasts you organize. Many of Bashar's citizens come to feast with you... though even when drunk they are careful not to offend their host. 
At the same time, you are aware that drinking and eating make some of your muscles turn into fat. Besides, all these pleasures simply make you lazy. You don't want to practice fencing every day, let alone risk your life in the arena. You tell Ashakar to choose less dangerous opponents, preferably ones without experience. The fight organizer is unhappy, but agrees to this arrangement. At first the spectators continue to come to your fights, the name of "The Slayer" has the power of attraction. But as time goes on, You become less and less popular. Most people are sick of watching you slaughter terrified newcomers to pieces, only the biggest sadists like it. One day an exasperated Ashakar announces that if this continues, he will stop organizing fights with your participation altogether, because they will simply cease to be profitable. And when the cash flow stops, the pleasures will also stop. 
You're trying to get back into shape, but it's probably too late. You're not a young man anymore and you're struggling to regain your old musculature and agility. It will be a long time before you can try to compete against the best again. Assuming you succeed at all, you will be out of the public eye by the time you do. No, your days of gladiatorial glory are over. You have to know when to leave the stage... and think of a way to secure your future. 
I may not be an active fighter anymore, but I have accumulated a lot of experience. I can train others (page 24). 
As long as I still have some gold, I need to invest (page 38).
