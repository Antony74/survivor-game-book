You jump out from behind the door and throw yourself from behind at the nearest thug. You put your arm around his neck. The villain curses, throws himself, and brandishes a hand armed with a knife. You point your other hand toward his face and stick your fingers in his eyes. The bandit screams and releases the knife on the floor. You release him from your grasp and reach for your gun. The thug rubs his eyes and then charges at you. You stab him in the stomach. The thug slumps to the ground. 
You look around. On the floor, besides the bandit you stabbed, who is writhing in pain, lie one of his companions and Gralen. Chilosh and Renel are kneeling by their son. Hradesz is leaning against the wall. One of his arms is hanging limply, the other is trying to shield himself from the blows of the bandit who is hitting him with a wooden club. You run up and stab the thug in the back. Then you pull the blade out and stick it in again, a little higher. The bandit is still able to turn around to face you, and then he falls. 
You can hear the crying. It is Renel crying, holding her son's body in her arms. Hradesz slowly walks towards you. 
- You saved my life - he says. - You... you deserve a reward. You'll be free. 
The next day they bury Gralen. The bandits end up in an unnamed pit, into which the town guard throws dead beggars. Then you and Hradesz go to the Temple of Wisdom, where the Baszar archives and books are located. There you are liberated. 
- Then you are free - your former master declares. - You can leave or stay. I advise you to stay. I will need a helper. Gralen is dead, his parents are devastated, and I am not up to the job yet either. - Hradesz points to his stiffened hand. - I will pay well. 
No. I will not remain where I was a slave. I will seek happiness on my own (page 76). 
If that's the case, I'll stay (page 51).
