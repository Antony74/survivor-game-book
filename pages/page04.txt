Over the next few days You are training in use of Your new powers. Your magical sight make bigger and bigger circles around an island. One day You see small trade boat. You use the power and the wind push boat toward an island. Surprised sailors start to explore new land. At this time You take off the helmet. You lose magical sight you're used to. You start blindly going to the exit from the temple. Y ou stumble along the way and fall flat on Your face, but You get up and move on. When You leave the temple, You start calling the people. Soon You start hearing voices. 
- Gods! He has no eyes! 
- Who do it to You, man? 
You say, that You are castaway. Eyes was taken by the power dwelling in the temple – it is cursed place, better don't go there. You say truth, from certain point of view. Superstitious sailors prefer not to visit dark building. They take pity on You and take You on their boat. 
Soon You come back to the continent. Sailors put You ashore – and this is the end of their good will. You are alone in foreing port city, without eyes. T he only thing that awaits you, is beggar's lot. You sit in front of local temple, wailing and asking passerbies for something to eat. Sometimes You get leftovers from someones dinner, sometimes small coin, sometimes kick. That's Your life now. 
THE END
