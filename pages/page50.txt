You take a sip from the bottle. The drink is sour. You feel... refreshed. You think more clearly, see more clearly. Then you look into the bowl. There is a knife. You take it in your hand, hesitate for a moment, and then start gouging out your eye. It hurts terribly, but you endure it, you have the impression that the pain flows somewhere next to you, as if you perceived it, not felt it. After a while you do the same with the other eye. You are completely blind. You reach the throne in the dark. You take off the helmet from the skeleton and put it on your head. Then you drop the corpse on the floor and sit on the throne yourself. 
You can see again! But not with your eyes, but somehow differently. Your field of vision keeps moving, though you don't turn your head. You try to focus on something... On these paintings. When you think of them, you immediately see them up close, as if you were standing in front of them. You try to look beyond the temple. You feel as if you have swept through the building like the wind and are outside, though you feel that you are still sitting on the throne. 
You start looking at the forest around you. At one point you notice a fruit hanging on a tree. You feel hungry and instinctively think of eating it. To your surprise, the fruit breaks away from the branch and starts flying through the air towards the temple. You follow it with your magic sight. You realize that you can steer it. You make it land in your lap. 
As you eat, you begin to wonder about the possibilities of your throne and helmet. How far does this power reach? What do you want to accomplish with it?
